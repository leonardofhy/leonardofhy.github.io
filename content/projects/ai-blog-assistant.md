This project experiments with a repeatable process for converting rough notes into markdown posts.

## What I focused on

- Content scaffolding with front matter templates.
- Auto-generating summary and tags from notes.
- Fast local check workflow before each deploy.

## Outcome

- Reduced post prep time significantly.
- Kept writing velocity high while maintaining consistent site structure.
